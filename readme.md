**Lab 3: Web Mapping Covid Cases by County Across The US**

In this project, I used mapbox to create a map of the covid cases in the US. I got data from [The New York Times](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/blob/43d32dde2f87bd4dafbb7d23f5d9e878124018b8/live/us-counties.csv), [2018 ACS 5 year estimates](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?g=0100000US.050000&d=ACS%205-Year%20Estimates%20Data%20Profiles&tid=ACSDP5Y2018.DP05&hidePreview=true), and [US Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/carto-boundary-file.html). These data were mapped in two different styles. One was a chloropleth map, and the other was a proportional symbol map. I used the choropleth map to show the number of cases per county, and the proportional symbol map also showed the same data but now in a proportional symbol style.
